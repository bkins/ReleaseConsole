.SYNOPSIS
Deploys a built Local AI Assistant Windows artifact to the local machine.

.DESCRIPTION
Copies the published Windows binaries from the staging path to the environment-specific
deploy directory. Stops any running instance of the app before copying, then backs up
the previous deployment. Mirrors the structure used by API-Deploy.ps1.

Deploy locations:
  Dev:  C:\CP\Deploy\LaaWindows\Dev
  QA:   C:\CP\Deploy\LaaWindows\QA
  Prod: C:\CP\Deploy\LaaWindows\Prod

.PARAMETER Environment
Target environment. Valid values: Dev, QA, Prod.

.PARAMETER Version
Version string matching the built artifact (used for logging and deployment state).

.PARAMETER ArtifactPath
Path to the directory containing the published binaries (output of LAA-Windows-Build.ps1).

.EXAMPLE
.\LAA-Windows-Deploy.ps1 -Environment Dev -Version 1.0.20260201.123045 -ArtifactPath "C:\CP\Deploy\LaaWindows"

.EXAMPLE
.\LAA-Windows-Deploy.ps1 -Environment QA -Version 1.0.20260201.140530 -ArtifactPath "C:\CP\Deploy\LaaWindows"
